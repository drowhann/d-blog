# Hi, I am Rohan Dhimal

I am a software engineer with a passion for building products that solve real world problems. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Cerner Corporation](https://www.cerner.com/). I am also a graduate student at [University of Missouri - Kansas City](https://www.umkc.edu/) pursuing my Masters in Computer Science.

I am a self-taught programmer and I love to learn new things. I am a big fan of open source and I try to contribute to open source projects whenever I can. I am also a big fan of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

I am a big fan of [Manchester United](https://www.manutd.com/) and I love to play and watch football. I also love to play video games and watch movies in my free time.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. If you have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rohandhimal) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohandhimal/).
